Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction and Analysis üöÄ

Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer lifetime value (CLTV) using advanced statistical and machine learning models. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights for a business by identifying its most valuable customers and forecasting future sales.

Key highlights of the project include:

Top 10 customers expected to make the most purchases within 1 month.
Total expected sales for the entire company over the next 3 months.
Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.

Dataset üìä



The dataset used for this analysis is the Online Retail II dataset. It contains transactional data for a UK-based online retailer, including customer purchase history between 2009 and 2011.

Methodology üß†


Data Preparation and Cleaning:

Removed missing or invalid entries (e.g., Customer ID, InvoiceDate).
Filtered for customers with at least one repeat purchase (frequency > 1).
Calculated key CLTV metrics:
Recency: Time since the customer's last purchase.
T: Customer's total lifespan (in weeks).
Frequency: Number of repeat purchases.
Monetary Value: Average revenue per purchase.

Modeling:

BG/NBD Model (Beta Geo Fitter):
Used to predict customer purchase frequency over time.
Gamma-Gamma Model:
Estimated the monetary value of customers based on past transactions.
Implemented with the lifetimes Python library for CLTV prediction.

Analysis:

Forecasted expected purchases for each customer over 1 and 3-month periods.
Ranked customers based on their predicted contribution to revenue.
Aggregated predictions to calculate company-wide sales estimates.

Results üìà


Insights
Top 10 Customers:
The 10 customers expected to make the most purchases within the next month were identified, enabling the business to focus marketing and retention efforts on them.

Company-Wide Forecast:
The total number of expected sales over the next 3 months is [X] (calculated using the BG/NBD model).

Customer Segmentation:
Customers were categorized into high-value and low-value segments based on their predicted CLTV, offering targeted business strategies for each group.

Key Metrics:
Metric	Value
Total Customers Analyzed	[X]
Top 10 Customer Predictions	[X Purchases]
Company-Wide 3-Month Sales	[X Purchases]
